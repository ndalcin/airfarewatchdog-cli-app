# AirfareWatchDog CLI

## Description

  This is a CLI that informs users of the best flight deals of the day as determined by AirfareWatchDog's website. The list the users see comes from their Top-50 Fares page that is updated daily, however some days there are not 50 deals. The user will be able to see the following information:
  route, price, airlines, stay requirements, travel days, travel period, and URLs for more information.

## Usage

  After cloning and checking out the repo run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/flightdeals` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
