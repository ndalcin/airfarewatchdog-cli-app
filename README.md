# AirfareWatchDog CLI

<!-- Make sure to create a good README.md with a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code. -->

## Description

  This is a CLI that informs users of the best flight deals of the day as determined by AirfareWatchDog's website. The list the users see comes from their Top-50 Fares page that is updated daily, however some days there are not 50 deals. The user will be able to see the following information:
  route, price, airlines, stay requirements, travel days, travel period, and URLs for more information.

## Installation




```ruby

```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
